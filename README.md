What this is
- A collection of hand-crafted HTML pages that simulate a modern bank portal:
  - Sign up, log in, and user dashboards
  - Account views, transactions and bills
  - Loan applications and approvals
  - Credit card applications, points and requests
  - Admin and banker interfaces to review requests and reports

Why it‚Äôs fun
- Instant demo: open a page and it's alive ‚Äî great for showing ideas to teammates or stakeholders.
- Multi-role feel: several pages give the sense of a full product (customer, banker, admin).
- Great starting point for building a real product or for teaching front-end concepts.
